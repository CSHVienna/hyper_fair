# hyperFA*IR: A Python library for generating, evaluating, and improving rankings under fairness constraints.

This package is tied to the paper [**hyperFA*IR: A hypergeometric approach to fair rankings with finite candidate pool**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3715275.3732143), published in the Proceedings of the 2025 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency (FAccT'25).

## Overview

**hyperFA*IR** is a rigorous framework for researchers and practitioners who care about fairness in ranked outcomes. Leveraging hypergeometric tests and Monte Carlo methods, hyperFA*IR enables you to rigorously assess, visualize, and enforce fairness in any ranking scenario with a finite candidate pool.

Whether you are working with admissions, hiring, recommendations, or any ranked selection process, hyperFA*IR provides the tools you need to ensure equitable representation and transparency.

- **Monte Carlo Simulations:** Accurately estimate p-values and confidence intervals for complex, sequential fairness tests using efficient Monte Carlo algorithms.
- **Fairness-Constrained Re-ranking:** Automatically adjust unfair rankings to satisfy fairness constraints, with support for custom significance levels and test directions.
- **Quota and Weighted Sampling Models:** Explore the impact of quotas and group-weighted selection on your rankings.
- **Comprehensive Visualization:** Instantly visualize rankings, group proportions, confidence intervals, and fairness bounds to communicate results clearly.
- **Performance and Scalability:** Designed for large datasets, with optimized algorithms that outperform existing methods in both speed and accuracy.


## Installation

You can directly install the package using pip:

```sh
pip install hyperfair
```

Or you can clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/CSHVienna/hyper_fair.git
cd hyper_fair
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start<a name="start">

Get started with a single line: compute the p-value for fairness in your ranking!

Suppose you have a ranking where `1` indicates a protected candidate and `0` an unprotected candidate. To test whether the protected group is under-represented in the top-$k$ positions, simply run:

```python
from hyperfair.hyperfair import measure_fairness_multiple_points

pvalue, _ = measure_fairness_multiple_points(
    x_seq=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],  # 1=protected, 0=unprotected
    k=10,  # Test the top 10 positions
    test_side='lower',  # Test for under-representation
    n_exp=100_000  # Number of Monte Carlo simulations
)
print(f"P-value: {pvalue:.3f}")
# Output: P-value: 0.023
```

This tells you how likely it is to observe as few protected candidates in the top $k$ as you did, under random selection. A small p-value (e.g., < 0.05) means the ranking is likely unfair to the protected group.

## How to use the library<a name="how-to">

### Loading data from a Pandas DataFrame

To analyze fairness in your rankings, you first need to load your data. The most stratight forward way is to load it from a Pandas DataFrame, and the package provides the [`load_data_from_pandas_df`](code/data_loader.py) function for this purpose. This function extracts the relevant ranking and protected attribute information from your DataFrame and prepares it for fairness analysis.

Suppose your DataFrame has the following structure:

|   ID | SES      |   Score |
|-----:|:---------|--------:|
|    0 | Low SES  |    4.82 |
|    1 | High SES |    6.87 |
|    2 | High SES |    7.84 |
|    3 | Low SES |    4.17 |
|    4 | High SES |    4.71 |
|  ... |   ...    |   ...   |

Here, `SES` (socioeconomic status) is the protected attribute, and `Score` is the ranking criterion.

To load and process this data, use:

```python
from hyperfair.data_loader import load_data_from_pandas_df
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv(CSV_PATH)
ranking, ids = load_data_from_pandas_df(
    df,
    protected_attribute='SES',
    binary_dict={'Low SES': 1, 'High SES': 0},
    id_attribute='ID',
    order_by='Score',
    ascending=False  # Set to True if higher scores are better
)
```

**Inputs:**
- `df`: A pandas DataFrame containing your ranking data.
- `protected_attribute`: The column name in `df` that indicates group membership.
- `binary_dict`: A dictionary mapping the values in the protected attribute column to 1 (protected group) and 0 (unprotected group).
- `id_attribute`: The column name in `df` that uniquely identifies each candidate. If None, it selects the index of the DataFrame.
- `order_by`: The column name in `df` used to rank candidates.

**Outputs:**
- `ranking`: A NumPy array of 0s and 1s, ordered by rank (after sorting), where 1 indicates a protected candidate and 0 an unprotected candidate. This is the main input for all fairness analysis functions.
- `ids`: A NumPy array of candidate IDs, ordered in the same way as `ranking`.

These outputs allow you to analyze the representation of protected and unprotected groups at every position in the ranking, and are required for all subsequent fairness tests and visualizations in the package.

### Sequential tests for fairness

A key feature of **hyperFA*IR** is the ability to test rankings for fairness at multiple cutoffs. For example, you may want to check if the protected group is under-represented in the top $k$ positions of your ranking, or across all prefixes [1:j] for $j=1,\ldots,k$.

To do this, use the [`measure_fairness_multiple_points`](code/hyperfair.py) function. This function performs sequential statistical tests (using Monte Carlo simulations) to determine whether the observed representation of the protected group is consistent with random selection.

Example usage:

```python
from hyperfair.hyperfair import measure_fairness_multiple_points

pvalue, generatedData = measure_fairness_multiple_points(
    x_seq=ranking,      # binary array: 1 if protected, 0 otherwise, ordered by rank
    k=30,               # number of top positions to test
    test_side='lower',  # test for under-representation
    n_exp=1000000       # number of Monte Carlo simulations
)
```
- `x_seq`: Binary array indicating protected group membership, sorted by ranking.
- `k`: Number of top positions (prefixes) to test.
- `test_side`: Use `'lower'` to test for under-representation, `'upper'` for over-representation, or `'two-sided'` for both.
- `n_exp`: Number of Monte Carlo simulations for estimating p-values.

The function returns the p-value for the fairness test and a `generatedData` object that can be reused for further analysis or re-ranking.

## Comparison with FA*IR<a name="fair">

Finally, in the paper we mention that our method to compute the adjusted parameter for multiple tests is more efficient than the one implemented in [FA*IR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06368) because it doesn't rely on the linear search of the optimal parameter.

To support our claim, we show the differences in speed (right plot below) between our method (in red) and the method implemented in the [companion repository](https://github.com/fair-search/fairsearch-fair-python) of the paper by Zehlike et al.. In particular, we show the elapsed time (in seconds) using a log-log plot, as a function of the length of the ranking.
For our Monte Carlo algorithm, we fixed the number of experiments to $100000$.

For small `n`, our method is slightly slower. However, this is also the scenario in which our method is significantly more accurate. When `n` increases, it is clear that our method is much more efficient (remember that the time is in log-scale!). 

For `n=2000` (last point), the difference is substantial: the elapsed time for Zehlike's algorithm is $2816$ seconds, while our algorithm only takes around $37$ seconds to run.
